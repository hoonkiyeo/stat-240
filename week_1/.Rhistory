## <- These hash tags allow you to comment-out the code; you can use multiple depending on your preference but only one is needed.
## 'knitr' is the package that turns R Markdown into a document
## The following command sets some options for this R Markdown file
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
## The `library()' function loads in a package; the package must already be installed.
## `tidyverse' is the name of the package we are loading next.  In particular, we will be using ggplot2.
library(tidyverse)
## We will also load the package called `lubridate.'  It is a part of `tidyverse', but it is not loaded in the core.
##  (This means we need to load it separately when we want to use it in our code.)
## The 'lubridate' package has useful functions for dates.
library(lubridate)
## `ice' is a new object.
## The `<-' assigns the loaded data set to the object name `ice.'
## You will see an '=' instead of a `<-' as the assignment operator; I use both, but many R books recommend the `<-.'
## read_csv() is a function in the tidyverse for reading in .csv files.
## There is a base R function named read.csv(). Use read_csv() instead.
## The argument to read_csv() is a path to the file with the data
## The '..' means go up a directory
## Use a '/' after a directory
##   (Windows uses backslashes, but slashes work in R for any computer system)
## The result of the code below is to create a data frame named ice
##   by reading in the data in the file.
ice <- read_csv("C:/stat_240/lake-mendota-year-clean.csv")
